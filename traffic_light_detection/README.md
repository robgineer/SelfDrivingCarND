# CarND Object Detection Lab

In lab this you will:

* Learn about *MobileNets* and separable depthwise convolutions.
* The SSD (Single Shot Detection) architecture used for object detection
* Use pretrained TensorFlow object detection inference models to detect objects
* Use different architectures and weight the tradeoffs.
* Apply an object detection pipeline to a video.

Open the notebook and work through it!
