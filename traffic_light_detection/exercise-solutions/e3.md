***Q: What are some ways which we can filter nonsensical bounding boxes?***

A: 

You may have come up with different answers. The SSD paper does 2 things:

1. Filters boxes based on IoU metric. For example, if a box has an IoU score
less than 0.5 on all ground truth boxes it's removed.
2. Hard negative mining. Most of the default box sizes won't perfectly
match the object. This leaves many negative matches for 1 positive
match. The authors sort by confidence scores to limit the negative to positive
ratio to at most 3:1.
