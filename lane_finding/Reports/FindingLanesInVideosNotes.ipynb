    "It turned out that my parameter selection used for the image detection was not good enough for videos. Therefore, I had to adjust the parameters for:\n",

    "2. The Canny thresholds as the edge detection had to be in a different greyscale\n",

    "A: Less Shaky Lines (using image flow)\n",
    "The projection of the lines that cover the lanes is calculated for each video frame and since these imply smaller changes and moreover, since the gaussian blur applied prior to the Canny algorithm has its limitations, a further improvement for \"smoother\" lines would be to introduce a \"memory\" that stores a set of previously calculated points (at frame_i-1,i-2,...i-n). These points should be for the (linear) fitting for the current frame (frame_i).\n",
    "\n",
    "B: Improved Fitting\n",
    "The lines projected using the code are calculated with a simple linear fit. This however would lead to poor results at least in the following cases:\n",
    "1. Curves\n",
    "2. Steep hills (e.g. San Francisco)\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, a non linear fit should be intoduced to enable an optimal fit in non linear environments.\n",
    "In my test runs, I have applied a non linear fit by adjusting the degree in np.polyfit (e.g. fittedRight=np.polyfit(rightLaneX, rightLaneY, 3).\n",
    "\n",
    "With this application one single line projection would not be sufficient, of course. \n",
