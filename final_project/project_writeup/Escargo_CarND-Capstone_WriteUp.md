# Escargo CarND-Capstone project write up

----------

## 1. Introduction
In the last project oft he Self-Driving-Car engineer Nanodegree course (Capstone) we implemented a ROS (Robotics Operating System) to help the Udacity car “Carla” maneuver autonomously on a test route. The speed was limited to 10mph for safety reasons. 
This capstone project brought together several aspects of the SDC Nanodegree promising Perception, Planning and Control.
First, the code is tested on the simulator and then we ran it on Carla. The code is written using the  ROS framework which works on the simulator and as well on Carla.
